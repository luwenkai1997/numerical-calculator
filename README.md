## Introduction

This project can help to solve some basic mathematical problems using numerical methods. It has four funcitons: 

1. Solving Polynomial Equations in R

2. Interpolation of (x,y) Data

3. Estimating Derivaticves

4. Integtation of Data

## Function 1: Solving Polynomial Equations in R

Function 1 can help to solve a polynomial function with degree less than or equal to 4.

For functions with degree 2, we can get exact roots through [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula).

For functions with degree 3 or higher, we will only get 1 root through [bisection method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method). There might be other roots existing other than the root this program provides.

[test case of degree 2 function](https://github.com/luwenkai1997/pic-10c-final-project/blob/master/test_case/test_case_2)

[test case of degree 3 function](https://github.com/luwenkai1997/pic-10c-final-project/blob/master/test_case/test_case_3)

## Function 2: Interpolation of (x,y) Data

Function 2 can help to aprroximate the value of a function through [Lagrange Polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial).
